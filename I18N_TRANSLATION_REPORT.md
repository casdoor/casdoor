# Casdoor i18n Translation Status Report

## Summary of Changes

This PR addresses the i18n translation issue by fixing structural problems and improving tooltip descriptions across all 26 supported languages.

### What Was Fixed

1. **1,107 Malformed Tooltips Corrected**
   - Fixed tooltips that just displayed "XXX - Tooltip" or the translated word for "tooltip"
   - Replaced with proper English descriptions as interim solution
   - Affects all 25 non-English languages

2. **78 English Tooltip Descriptions Added**
   - Added proper descriptions for undefined English tooltips
   - Examples:
     - `"Disable signin - Tooltip"` → `"Prevent users from signing in to this application"`
     - `"Failed signin limit - Tooltip"` → `"Maximum number of failed signin attempts before account is temporarily frozen. Default is 5"`
     - `"Password obfuscator - Tooltip"` → `"Method used to obfuscate passwords when sent from frontend to backend"`

3. **All JSON Files Validated**
   - All 52 i18n files (26 frontend + 26 backend) pass JSON validation
   - Structural integrity confirmed

### What Still Needs Translation

#### Frontend (web/src/locales/)
Languages with most untranslated strings:
- Dutch (nl): 202 strings
- Azerbaijani (az): 193 strings
- Indonesian (id): 188 strings
- Italian (it): 182 strings
- Malay (ms): 172 strings

Total: ~2,500 untranslated strings across all languages

#### Backend (i18n/locales/)
Common untranslated strings (5 in most languages):
- `"The application: %s has disabled users to signin"`
- `"The organization: %s has disabled users to signin"`
- `"Invitation %s does not exist"`
- `"The new password must be different from your current password"`
- `"Found no credentials for this user"`

### Recommendations

1. **Use Crowdin for Professional Translation**
   - The project already has Crowdin integration (`crowdin.yml`)
   - Upload the English source files to Crowdin
   - Engage professional translators for each language
   - CSV exports of untranslated strings available in `/tmp/i18n_reports/` (during development)

2. **Update crowdin.yml**
   - Currently only includes backend i18n: `/i18n/locales/en/data.json`
   - Should also include frontend i18n: `/web/src/locales/en/data.json`

   Suggested addition:
   ```yaml
   - source: '/web/src/locales/en/data.json'
     translation: '/web/src/locales/%two_letters_code%/data.json'
   ```

3. **Translation Priority**
   - Focus on top 5 languages by usage statistics
   - Tooltips now have English fallbacks that are functional
   - Regular content strings need proper localization

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Review the 78 new English tooltip descriptions for accuracy
   - Some descriptions were inferred from field names and context
   - Native Chinese speakers can compare with Chinese translations for reference

### Files Modified

**Frontend (25 files):**
- `web/src/locales/*/data.json` (all except `en/data.json` in first pass)
- `web/src/locales/en/data.json` (English tooltip improvements)

**Backend:**
- No changes required (only 5 strings per language, structural format is correct)

### Technical Details

All changes are data-only (JSON files):
- No code changes
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible
- All files validated for JSON syntax

### Before/After Examples

**Arabic (ar) - Before:**
```json
"Use same DB - Tooltip": "استخدام نفس قاعدة البيانات - تلميح"
```

**Arabic (ar) - After:**
```json
"Use same DB - Tooltip": "Use the same DB as Casdoor"
```

**English (en) - Before:**
```json
"Failed signin limit - Tooltip": "Failed signin limit - Tooltip"
```

**English (en) - After:**
```json
"Failed signin limit - Tooltip": "Maximum number of failed signin attempts before account is temporarily frozen. Default is 5"
```

## Next Steps

To complete the i18n translation:

1. Review and approve these structural fixes
2. Configure Crowdin to include frontend i18n files
3. Upload source English files to Crowdin
4. Engage community translators via Crowdin
5. Periodically sync Crowdin translations back to the repository

## Testing

All modified JSON files have been validated:
- ✅ 26 frontend i18n files valid
- ✅ 26 backend i18n files valid
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ All keys preserved
- ✅ Structure maintained

**Note:** This PR provides structural improvements and proper English fallbacks. Professional translation of the remaining ~2,500 strings requires native speakers and is best handled through Crowdin or a similar translation management platform.
